1.            Support Continuity: Ensure that both mentors and mentees feel supported as they progress through the program.

2.            Reflection and Celebration: Recognise and celebrate the achievements of both mentors and mentees to date. This aims to boost morale and motivation.

3.            Strategic Planning: Discuss and plan the next steps for the remainder of the program, with a particular focus on Public Sector Reform. This includes setting new goals, adjusting existing ones, and outlining a clear roadmap for the future.

I look forward to a discussion.

Many thanks,

Jarad

    [info_provided] => Levande has approximately 58 retirement villages across QLD, NSW, VIC & SA. 

We have wellbeing coordinators in half of these villages, and then people who manage the wellbeing for multiple smaller villages (like me who has 5 villages 😊). 

On top of this, we have a Customer Wellbeing team who manages our Wellbeing Coordinators and the wellbeing programs that we have for our residents. 

I was hoping to organise a chat for the whole wellbeing team specifically and would also be interested in doing an online seminar for the entire company.

    [info_provided] => Hi I am an Occupational Therapist working and living in a remote town on the east coast of Tassie (St helens) our school in St Helens has so many problems with bullying and desperately needs a change. Our school principle is not on board and actually rejects every change. A group of parents would be happy to pay for this project, but the principle prefers to do nothing and denies that any bullying is happening on that school. I would love to hear if you had any similar experiences like this and advice of how to approach and hopefully go ahead with this!
Many Thanks Julia

Our workforce is majority made up by a Fly in Fly out crew, we also have our Head office/workshop in Port Hedland (Regional Mining Town in WA), and then a small team in Perth.
We work in Mining/ Heavy Machinery industries.
Our team are mechanics, auto electricians, electricians, boiler makers, services person, apprentices, and administration.
We have around 80 employees, 85% Male. 
I think many may enter this with a negative stereotype. I am thinking our best luck would be something live, whether in Person or online. 
I do think we could find other businesses in Port Hedland who might find this beneficial, if there is a minimum number requirement.

    [info_provided] => Really interested in the program, we have been on a journey of implementing mental health strategies into the business and identifying hazards and controls. We have a strong awareness in the business for mental health and wellbeing, but we have a large blue collar work force, and the connection between feeling good and having a positive outcome of high risk work, versus not feeling so great and have adverse outcomes is something that we are continuley concerned about. The resilience project seems to be very much aligned with our thinking into how we need to show up, but also knowing that it is okay to speak up and seek help if we are not. We are 4000 strong government enterprise organisation.

This proposed event aims to foster professional identity, strengthen internal culture, celebrate progress, and build a cohesive shared vision for the future that is aligned with the Council Plan and strategic Direction .While operational alignment has largely been achieved, there remains an ongoing need to:
•	Deepen professional and cultural cohesion
•	Strengthen inter-team relationships
•	Reflect on lessons learned and map a shared strategic direction
•	Celebrate collective achievements and diversity
Wanting to investigate Professional Development Workshop (2-3 hours?)
Topic aligned with team values and current needs (e.g. trauma-informed care, cultural safety, strengths-based collaboration, or leadership in community work)
•	Facilitated by an internal expert or invited speaker

    [info_provided] => Hi there,

My name is Yun Zhang, and I’m the Regional Manager for Ignite Health Care’s South East region. We are a registered NDIS provider with a multidisciplinary allied health team including Occupational Therapists, Physiotherapists, Speech Pathologists, and Positive Behaviour Support practitioners.

I had the pleasure of attending one of your teacher wellbeing seminars a few years ago when I was working as a school counsellor, and I found it incredibly insightful particularly in helping me reframe challenges and improve my mental wellbeing in the workplace.

Our clinicians support a diverse group of vulnerable participants and often face significant emotional and professional challenges, especially those who are newly graduated and transitioning into full-time roles. Balancing clinical work, self-care, and business objectives can be both rewarding and demanding.

I’m hoping to explore how we might introduce your program to our team (around 25 clinicians in total at the South East hub). Could you please advise what engagement options might be most suitable.
We’d love to learn more about your available talks or wellbeing programs that could support our clinicians’ resilience and professional growth.

Thank you very much for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Warm regards,
